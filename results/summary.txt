    Feb 17
    toy simulation now correctly run with dspaces and catalyst
    vtk files can be generated
1996628
    Feb 17
    all previous applciation can be run, put regions, get regions, analysis
1996637
    Feb 17
    same with 1996628, but with folder created for results
1996796
    Feb 18
    test basic applications again, after modifying the cmake
1997062.m2*
    Feb 18 16:00
    openfoam connected with catalyst, vtk files are successfully generated
1998457.m2
    Feb 19 11:00
    data put into dspaces are different that if directly run file witer in openfoam

    <<U[i] and <<U[i]

    Feb 19 11:59
    put_raw buffer change the value of vel_data
1998807
    Feb 19 13:40
    changed cavity configuration, now 1 step passed
1998862
    Feb 19 16:39
    timestep > 10, floating point err
1999631
    Feb 19 22:55
    change the cavaty parameters back, now only mesh definition changed from 20 to 40
200431
    Feb 20 11:13
    now that server crashes,
    reason: previously all variables are write into different variables and use different locks.
    fixed it: 
        after change version number to 1 and allow at most 1 user in catalyst/ NEED TO SET HOW MANY USERS IN JOB FILE.

        Catalyst generate continous live visualization and connnect to client.(after setting sleep time 2)

    Feb 22 
        analysis algorithm has segmentation fault
2003794
    Feb 22
        infinite divergence
2003872
    Feb 22
        changed deltaT==0.0005 and endTime=0.5, regenerated blockMesh,  now no infinite numbers
2004013
    Feb 22
        work functionality works fine, now check generated vtk files
2005211
    Feng 22
        using fix time lock, and only 1 consumer, it's okay
2005214
    Feb 22
        increase to 12 consumers(4 nodes), get blocked
        reason: dspaces_init(1,4, ...) in icofoam should be dspaces_init(nprocs, 4, ...)
2005957
    Feb 23
    reason in the jobfile I wrote:$CMD_CONSUME, a 'R' is missing
2005998
    Feb 23
    now applications are running, but consumer 'address in use'
2006263
    Feb 23
    same code if set num_sim =1, in build_1,use same lock result is correct
2006265
    Feb 23
    num_sim =1, build_1, 10 consumers, use same lock, get blocked as expected
2006438
    Feb 24
    Fixed the zero divs (make sure all sub simulator doesn't have overlaps in dspaces)
2008442 
    Feb 26
    Config:
        64 sim procs
        128consumer
        4 server
        1 analyst
        total 15 nodes
    Error
2009685
    Feb 26
    config
        16 sim procs
        32 consumer
        2 server
        1 analyst 
        1 catalyst
    Floating point error
2010679
    Feb 27
    changed the case into cavity_fine_1025, err in consumer address not mapped
2011525
    Feb 27
    seems distance matrix of A only execute one iteration
    add print and see what happens
2033729
    Mar 5
    err 11 when receiving from dspaces
    1. changed nprocs_consumer
    2. blockMesh generated again
2036132
    mar 5
    fixed: dimension error, caused by cmake cmake -DADD_FLAGS=-DPROCS_PER_DIM=2 .. >cmake.log in build_1
2036701
    Mar 5 16:41
    get global samples blocked. now using 1 consumer instead
2039028
    mar 6 09:16
    vel and pres read as 0.000
2039091
    mar 6 09:31
    icofoam writter has buffer 0.000, but icofoam file i/o output is not
    1. memory copy function order of dest and source
    2. previous regions are overlapped, bottomnost =0 the border is not written
2039925
    Mar 6   11:34
    region No.39 has inf divs, the velocity values are all 0s
204035
    mar 6  11:45
    divergence are correctly calculated and read by analysis
2040531
    Mar 6 14:08
    all good until timstep3
2040926 & 2041744
    Mar 6 17:02
    2040926 analysis read err 11
    2041744 consumer read err 11
2042522
    Mar 7 02:07
    two consumer, cal_local_divs segmentation fault
2043081
    Mar 7 02:59
    generate lookup_table, should use num_sample_all as input
2043085
    Mar 7 03:10
    now error at timestep 98
2043099
    Mar 7 04:32
    if use 4 producers and 8 consumers, different procs read different contents from global samples
2043110
    mpi_barrier doesn't work
2043190
    even raw data getting has problem
2043363
    add gdim def, all consumer get -11 for raw data
2043370
    rm all gdim def other than in catalyst, now raw data is fine , errr is same with 2043099
2043373
    without dgim in icofam, raw data reading in consumer is fine, reading local samples are problems
2043378
    with gdim in icofoam, raw data reading in consumer all return -11, gdim err?
2043379
    use {NUM_POINTS, NUMPOINTS, NUMPOINTS} and gdim, now  half consumers can get vel correctly. half still get -11 err
2043440
    Mar 8
    raw data getting error
2043970
    Mar 8
    aec8192e0
    samples still have getting error, but now all iterations can be done.
    
2043975
    Mar 8
    consumer 2 and consumer 5 get different raw data
    
2045384
    if only use gdim_define in myicofoam, both consumer and catalyst get -11(compared with nothing in 2044683)
    I need to specifiy gdim in both ?
    yes! , see 2045390
2045401
    now changed the dims of other variables but No.3 consumer still get zero values of global samples
2045537
    this gives correct result but only once..

2046913
    medoids get err in consumer
