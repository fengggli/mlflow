    toy simulation now correctly run with dspaces and catalyst
    vtk files can be generated
1996628
    Feb 17
    all previous applciation can be run, put regions, get regions, analysis
1996637
    Feb 17
    same with 1996628, but with folder created for results

    test basic applications again, after modifying the cmake

    openfoam connected with catalyst, vtk files are successfully generated
1998457.m2

    data put into dspaces are different that if directly run file witer in openfoam

    <<U[i] and <<U[i]

    put_raw buffer change the value of vel_data

    Feb 19 13:40
    changed cavity configuration, now 1 step passed
1998862
    Feb 19 16:39
    timestep > 10, floating point err

    Feb 19 22:55
    change the cavaty parameters back, now only mesh definition changed from 20 to 40

    now that server crashes,
    reason: previously all variables are write into different variables and use different locks.
    fixed it: 
        after change version number to 1 and allow at most 1 user in catalyst/ NEED TO SET HOW MANY USERS IN JOB FILE.

        Catalyst generate continous live visualization and connnect to client.(after setting sleep time 2)

        analysis algorithm has segmentation fault
2003794
    Feb 22
        infinite divergence
2003872
    Feb 22
        changed deltaT==0.0005 and endTime=0.5, regenerated blockMesh,  now no infinite numbers

        work functionality works fine, now check generated vtk files

        using fix time lock, and only 1 consumer, it's okay
2005214
    Feb 22
        increase to 12 consumers(4 nodes), get blocked
        reason: dspaces_init(1,4, ...) in icofoam should be dspaces_init(nprocs, 4, ...)

    Feb 23
    reason in the jobfile I wrote:$CMD_CONSUME, a 'R' is missing
2005998
    Feb 23
    now applications are running, but consumer 'address in use'
2006263
    Feb 23
    same code if set num_sim =1, in build_1,use same lock result is correct
2006265
    Feb 23
    num_sim =1, build_1, 10 consumers, use same lock, get blocked as expected
2006438
    Feb 24
    Fixed the zero divs (make sure all sub simulator doesn't have overlaps in dspaces)
