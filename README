quick start of vertex machine learning
get a slice of turbulence data from John Hopkins
seperate the data into regions
feed the data into sequential machine learning method k-medroid with
verify with synthetic data.

write the algorithm first

Code has three parts:
dspaces_server:
    how the data looks like
put_regions
    generate the regions(by hdf5 file) and put into dspaces
get_regions
    get from regions and calculate divergence
analysis part
    Using the divergence results from 'get_regions', clustering


Notes:

position need to be modified when change pe number:
    1. aprun ds_server -c 
    2. max_reader
