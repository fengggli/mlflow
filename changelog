## [0.2.3.2] -2017-01-27
### changed
- ds_adator will take over all ds operations in simulator and catalyst
- now ds_server is also dynamically linked

### Changed
-  dspace opertion in get_regions.c is splited into seperate functions

...

## [0.1.x] -2017-1-xx
### Finished
- add dataspaces support
- consumer, producer and analyser are linked and dspaces locks are used to
