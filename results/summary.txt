    toy simulation now correctly run with dspaces and catalyst
    vtk files can be generated
1996628
    Feb 17
    all previous applciation can be run, put regions, get regions, analysis
1996637
    Feb 17
    same with 1996628, but with folder created for results
1996796
    Feb 18
    test basic applications again, after modifying the cmake
1997062.m2*
    Feb 18 16:00
    openfoam connected with catalyst, vtk files are successfully generated
1998457.m2
    Feb 19 11:00
    data put into dspaces are different that if directly run file witer in openfoam

    <<U[i] and <<U[i]

    Feb 19 11:59
    put_raw buffer change the value of vel_data
1998807
    Feb 19 13:40
    changed cavity configuration, now 1 step passed
1998862
    Feb 19 16:39
    timestep > 10, floating point err
1999631
    Feb 19 22:55
    change the cavaty parameters back, now only mesh definition changed from 20 to 40

    now that server crashes,
    reason: previously all variables are write into different variables and use different locks.
    fixed it: 
        after change version number to 1 and allow at most 1 user in catalyst/ NEED TO SET HOW MANY USERS IN JOB FILE.

        Catalyst generate continous live visualization and connnect to client.(after setting sleep time 2)

        analysis algorithm has segmentation fault
2003794
    Feb 22
        infinite divergence
2003872
    Feb 22
        changed deltaT==0.0005 and endTime=0.5, regenerated blockMesh,  now no infinite numbers

    Feb 22
        work functionality works fine, now check generated vtk files

        using fix time lock, and only 1 consumer, it's okay
2005214
    Feb 22
        increase to 12 consumers(4 nodes), get blocked
        reason: dspaces_init(1,4, ...) in icofoam should be dspaces_init(nprocs, 4, ...)
2005957
    Feb 23
    reason in the jobfile I wrote:$CMD_CONSUME, a 'R' is missing
2005998
    Feb 23
    now applications are running, but consumer 'address in use'
2006263
    Feb 23
    same code if set num_sim =1, in build_1,use same lock result is correct
2006265
    Feb 23
    num_sim =1, build_1, 10 consumers, use same lock, get blocked as expected
2006438
    Feb 24
    Fixed the zero divs (make sure all sub simulator doesn't have overlaps in dspaces)
2008442 
    Feb 26
    Config:
        64 sim procs
        128consumer
        4 server
        1 analyst
        total 15 nodes
    Error

    Feb 26
    config
        16 sim procs
        32 consumer
        2 server
        1 analyst 
        1 catalyst
    Floating point error

    Feb 27
    changed the case into cavity_fine_1025, err in consumer address not mapped
2011525
    Feb 27
    seems distance matrix of A only execute one iteration
    add print and see what happens

    Mar 5
    err 11 when receiving from dspaces
    1. changed nprocs_consumer
    2. blockMesh generated again
2036132
    mar 5
    fixed: dimension error, caused by cmake cmake -DADD_FLAGS=-DPROCS_PER_DIM=2 .. >cmake.log in build_1
2036701
    Mar 5 16:41
    get global samples blocked. now using 1 consumer instead
