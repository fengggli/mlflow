- c / python bindings
    - maybe: real matlab bindings, if the boost clash can be figured out

- CLI improvements
    - progress bar

- decide on index type more intelligently

- figure out some clever way to avoid repeated work in div funcs?
    - ie to do both BC and Hellinger without recomputing the common alpha part
    - possibly not worth the effort...

- don't compute both directions unless a div func needs both
    - add a typedef to div funcs noting this?

- more tests
    - one where bag sizes are different
        - but the matlab estimator is wrong here:
          L2 crashes, alpha-based have wrong constant

- used a fused-source version of gtest
    - need to make that work with cmake...
